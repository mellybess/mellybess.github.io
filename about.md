I'm Melissa. I'm into true crime and I'm also taking some time to learn python and some other tools for data analysis.  I'll be exploring different data sets about murder and violent crimes while I learn tools and techniques for finding and illustrating patterns. And I'm going to write a post a week on my progress.
